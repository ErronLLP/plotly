        <h1>Emotion qualia structure of 75 videos in 3D space</h1>
        <h2>This qualia structure estimated from mean similarity matrix of all participants (N = 599). Color is encoded by the values of “valence” and “arousal”, from Cowen & Keltner (2017)</h2>
        <h3>From this figure, we can see video with similar valence and arousal are clustered together. The next step is to compare the qualia structure between alexithymia and typical particpants.</h3>
        <p>Try to interact with this plot by mouse drag to rotate the structure; 
            hover the cursor over points to see more information; 
            select another variables from middle-top's drag-down list to encode colors. </p>
