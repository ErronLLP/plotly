        <h1>Emotion qualia structure of 75 videos in 3D space</h1>
        <h2>This qualia structure estimated from mean similarity matrix of all participants (N = 599). Color is encoded by the values of “valence” or “arousal”, from Cowen & Keltner (2017)</h2>
        <h3>From this figure, we can see videos with similar valence are clustered together, but in the case of arousal, this pattern is not so salience. The next step is to compare the qualia structure between alexithymia and typical particpants.</h3>
        <p>You can interact with this plot by mouse drag to rotate the structure; 
            hover the cursor over points to see more information; 
            select valence/arousal from middle-top's drag-down list to encode colors. </p>
